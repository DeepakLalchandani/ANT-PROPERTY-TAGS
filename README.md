I have mistakenly deleted project_build.properties file and i have to create it again and i am not able to do that.

I'm using ant as a build tool but i have some issues with the build.xml file.

Properties tag are not set for $ related fields becoz of which build is failing.

Can you provide addition of property tags for $ related fields so that my build.xml file runs successfully.

Please help me and consider this as a request.

Attaching is build.xml file for your reference.
